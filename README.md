The purpose of this assignment was to create a timer-based coding assessment using JavaScript that behaves like so:
The application has a few multiple choice question which have to be completed in a certain amount of time.
Every wrong answer will decrease the time remaining. Once completed your score will be shown and you will be able to store your score using local storage.

The application will be deployed on :https://psong562.github.io/quizInJava/
